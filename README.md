# Description:
This was side project to learn some basic animations using GSAP/ GreenSock JS animations for the first time.

# What I learned:
- experimented on the timing of animations for better transition on the eyes
- practiced and created separate functions for different groups of the animation for code readability (animations for the text/ image/ button.. etc)
- to create a "master" variable to call/ initiate the animated functions... this is for easy code review and maintainence.
